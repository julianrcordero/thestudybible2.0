    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="8">Now there arose a new king over Egypt, <crossref let="e" cid="c02001008.1"/>who did not know Joseph.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v02001009"/>
    <verse num="9">And he said to his people, <q class="begin-double" qid="02001009.1" from="02001009.1" to="02001010.1"/>Behold, <crossref let="f" cid="c02001009.1"/>the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v02001010"/>
    <verse num="10"><crossref let="g" cid="c02001010.1"/>Come, <crossref let="h" cid="c02001010.2"/>let us deal shrewdly with them, lest they multiply, and, if war breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land.<q class="end-double" qid="02001010.1" from="02001009.1" to="02001010.1"/></verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v02001012"/>
    <verse num="12">But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad. And the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v02001013"/>
    <verse num="13">So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel <crossref let="m" cid="c02001013.1"/>work as slaves</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v02001014"/>
    <verse num="14">and <crossref let="n" cid="c02001014.1"/>made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and brick, and in all kinds of work in the field. In all their work they ruthlessly made them work as slaves.</verse>

    <verse num="15">Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and the other Puah,</verse>

    <verse num="16"><q class="begin-double" qid="02001016.1" from="02001016.1" to="02001016.2"/>When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him, but if it is a daughter, she shall live.<q class="end-double" qid="02001016.2" from="02001016.1" to="02001016.2"/></verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v02001017"/>
    <verse num="17">But the midwives <crossref let="o" cid="c02001017.1"/>feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but let the male children live.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v02001018"/>
    <verse num="18">So the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them, <q class="begin-double" qid="02001018.1" from="02001018.1" to="02001018.2"/>Why have you done this, and let the male children live?<q class="end-double" qid="02001018.2" from="02001018.1" to="02001018.2"/></verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v02001020"/>
    <verse num="20"><crossref let="p" cid="c02001020.1"/>So God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied and grew very strong.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v02001021"/>
    <verse num="21">And because the midwives feared God, <crossref let="q" cid="c02001021.1"/>he gave them families.</verse>
