    <verse num="5">Now there was a Jew in Susa the citadel whose name was <crossref let="x" cid="c17002005.1"/>Mordecai, the son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a Benjaminite,</verse>

    <verse num="7">He was bringing up Hadassah, that is Esther, <crossref let="z" cid="c17002007.1"/>the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother.

    <verse num="9">And the young woman pleased him and won his favor.
