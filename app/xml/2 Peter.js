    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v61001004"/>
    <verse num="4">by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become <crossref let="g" cid="c61001004.1"/>partakers of the divine nature, <crossref let="h" cid="c61001004.2"/>having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v61001005"/>
    <verse num="5">For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith <crossref let="i" cid="c61001005.1"/>with virtue,<note nid="n61001005.1"/> and virtue <crossref let="j" cid="c61001005.2"/>with knowledge,</verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v61001009"/>
