    <heading>Encouragement to Give Generously</heading>
    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="1">We want you to know, brothers,<note nid="n47008001.1"/> about the grace of God that has been <crossref let="h" cid="c47008001.1"/>given among the churches of Macedonia,</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008002"/>
    <verse num="2">for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and <crossref let="i" cid="c47008002.1"/>their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008003"/>
    <verse num="3">For they gave <crossref let="j" cid="c47008003.1"/>according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own accord,</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008004"/>
    <verse num="4">begging us earnestly <crossref let="k" cid="c47008004.1"/>for the favor<note nid="n47008004.1"/> of taking part in <crossref let="l" cid="c47008004.2"/>the relief of the saints&#8212;</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008005"/>
    <verse num="5">and this, not as we expected, but they <crossref let="m" cid="c47008005.1"/>gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008006"/>
    <verse num="6">Accordingly, <crossref let="n" cid="c47008006.1"/>we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you <crossref let="o" cid="c47008006.2"/>this act of grace.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008007"/>
    <verse num="7">But as <crossref let="p" cid="c47008007.1"/>you excel in everything&#8212;in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you<note nid="n47008007.1"/>&#8212;<crossref let="q" cid="c47008007.2"/>see that you excel in this act of grace also.</verse>
    <end-paragraph/>

    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="8"><crossref let="r" cid="c47008008.1"/>I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008009"/>
    <verse num="9">For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that <crossref let="s" cid="c47008009.1"/>though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008010"/>
    <verse num="10">And in this matter <crossref let="t" cid="c47008010.1"/>I give my judgment: <crossref let="u" cid="c47008010.2"/>this benefits you, who <crossref let="v" cid="c47008010.3"/>a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008011"/>
    <verse num="11">So now finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008012"/>
    <verse num="12">For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable <crossref let="w" cid="c47008012.1"/>according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008013"/>
    <verse num="13">For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, but that as a matter of fairness</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008014"/>
    <verse num="14">your abundance at the present time should supply <crossref let="x" cid="c47008014.1"/>their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be fairness.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008015"/>
    <verse num="15">As it is written, <crossref let="y" cid="c47008015.1"/><crossref cid="t47008015.1"/><q class="begin-double" qid="47008015.1" from="47008015.1" to="47008015.2"/>Whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack.<q class="end-double" qid="47008015.2" from="47008015.1" to="47008015.2"/></verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008017"/>
    <verse num="17">For <crossref let="b" cid="c47008017.1"/>he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going<note nid="n47008017.1"/> to you of his own accord.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008018"/>
    <verse num="18">With him we are sending<note nid="n47008018.1"/> <crossref let="c" cid="c47008018.1"/>the brother who is famous among <crossref let="d" cid="c47008018.2"/>all the churches for his preaching of the gospel.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008019"/>
    <verse num="19">And not only that, but he has been <crossref let="e" cid="c47008019.1"/>appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of <crossref let="f" cid="c47008019.2"/>grace that is being ministered by us, <crossref let="g" cid="c47008019.3"/>for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008020"/>
    <verse num="20">We take this course so that no one should blame us about this generous gift that is being administered by us,</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008021"/>
    <verse num="21">for <crossref let="h" cid="c47008021.1"/>we aim at what is honorable <crossref let="i" cid="c47008021.2"/>not only in the Lord&apos;s sight but also in the sight of man.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008022"/>
    <verse num="22">And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008023"/>
    <verse num="23">As for Titus, he is <crossref let="j" cid="c47008023.1"/>my partner and fellow worker for your benefit. And as for our brothers, they are messengers<note nid="n47008023.1"/> of the churches, the glory of Christ.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47008024"/>
    <verse num="24">So give proof before the churches of your love and of <crossref let="k" cid="c47008024.1"/>our boasting about you to these men.</verse>

    <heading>The Collection for Christians in Jerusalem</heading>
    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="1">Now <crossref let="l" cid="c47009001.1"/>it is superfluous for me to write to you about <crossref let="m" cid="c47009001.2"/>the ministry for the saints,</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47009002"/>
    <verse num="2">for I know your readiness, <crossref let="n" cid="c47009002.1"/>of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready <crossref let="o" cid="c47009002.2"/>since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47009003"/>
    <verse num="3">But <crossref let="p" cid="c47009003.1"/>I am sending<note nid="n47009003.1"/> the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, <crossref let="q" cid="c47009003.2"/>as I said you would be.</verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v47009005"/>
    <verse num="5">So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the <crossref let="s" cid="c47009005.1"/>gift<note nid="n47009005.1"/> you have promised, so that it may be ready <crossref let="t" cid="c47009005.2"/>as a willing gift, <crossref let="u" cid="c47009005.3"/>not as an exaction.<note nid="n47009005.2"/></verse>
