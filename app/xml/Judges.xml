    <heading>A Levite and His Concubine</heading>
    <begin-paragraph/>
    <verse num="1">In those days, <crossref let="x" cid="c07019001.1"/>when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of <crossref let="y" cid="c07019001.2"/>the hill country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine from <crossref let="z" cid="c07019001.3"/>Bethlehem in Judah.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019002"/>
    <verse num="2">And his concubine was unfaithful to<note nid="n07019002.1"/> him, and she went away from him to her father&apos;s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019003"/>
    <verse num="3">Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father&apos;s house. And when the girl&apos;s father saw him, he came with joy to meet him.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019004"/>
    <verse num="4">And his father-in-law, the girl&apos;s father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and spent the night there.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019005"/>
    <verse num="5">And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the girl&apos;s father said to his son-in-law, <crossref let="a" cid="c07019005.1"/><q class="begin-double" qid="07019005.1" from="07019005.1" to="07019005.2"/>Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go.<q class="end-double" qid="07019005.2" from="07019005.1" to="07019005.2"/></verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019006"/>
    <verse num="6">So the two of them sat and ate and drank together. And the girl&apos;s father said to the man, <q class="begin-double" qid="07019006.1" from="07019006.1" to="07019006.2"/>Be pleased to spend the night, and <crossref let="b" cid="c07019006.1"/>let your heart be merry.<q class="end-double" qid="07019006.2" from="07019006.1" to="07019006.2"/></verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019007"/>
    <verse num="7">And when the man rose up to go, his father-in-law pressed him, till he spent the night there again.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019008"/>
    <verse num="8">And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart. And the girl&apos;s father said, <crossref let="c" cid="c07019008.1"/><q class="begin-double" qid="07019008.1" from="07019008.1" to="07019008.2"/>Strengthen your heart and wait until the day declines.<q class="end-double" qid="07019008.2" from="07019008.1" to="07019008.2"/> So they ate, both of them.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019009"/>
    <verse num="9">And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl&apos;s father, said to him, <q class="begin-double" qid="07019009.1" from="07019009.1" to="07019009.2"/>Behold, now the day has waned toward evening. Please, spend the night. Behold, the day draws to its close.

    <verse num="10">But the man would not spend the night. He rose up and departed and arrived opposite <crossref let="d" cid="c07019010.1"/>Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him.</verse>
    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019011"/>
    <verse num="11">When they were near Jebus, the day was nearly over, and the servant said to his master, <q class="begin-double" qid="07019011.1" from="07019011.1" to="07019011.2"/>Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it.<q class="end-double" qid="07019011.2" from="07019011.1" to="07019011.2"/></verse>

    <marker class="begin-verse" mid="v07019015"/>
    <verse num="15">and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibeah. And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city, <crossref let="g" cid="c07019015.1"/>for no one took them into his house to spend the night.</verse>
